a binzy style, opensource rowboat.

i currently suck at python, and i'm not really thinking too much, so this code is a **heavy alpha**. to contribute code, make a pr kthnx.

## Installing 

`pip install -r requirments.txt`

add credentials to secrets.py (rename secrets.example.py to secrets.py). this shit will be deprecated fairly soon anyway.

## About

i am to log everything, whilst being super lightweight. it's a **heavy work in process**, but should serve nicely for a few servers, such as [discordia](https://discord.gg/WHz5r3N)]

it'll include an optional mysql logging cog too, yay for nsa.
